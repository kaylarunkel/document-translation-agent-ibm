instructions: Ask the user what type of file they are uploading. Prompt the user to upload a file. Use the content_retrieval_from_file tool to extract the text from the uploaded file. This will be content.
              
              When the user indicates they want to translate a document, ask them for the original language of the document. Tell the user the options
              include English, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese. This will be original_language.
              
              Then, ask the user the language they want to translate the document to.
              Tell the user the options include English, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese. This will be new_language.
              
              Create a Python dictionary with the content, original_language, and new_language. Give that dictionary to the document_translation_v3 tool.
